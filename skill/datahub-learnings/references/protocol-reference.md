# Protocol Reference (condensed)

Quick-lookup version of `protocol/SPEC.md` §3–4 for use mid-task. The normative source is
`protocol/SPEC.md`. If this file and SPEC.md ever disagree, SPEC.md wins.

## The five learning kinds (SPEC.md §3)

Every learning has exactly one `kind`. Do not invent new kinds: v1 is a fixed set.

| Kind | Use when | One-line example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `semantic_gotcha` | A value's unit, encoding, or scope differs from what its name/type implies. | `amount` is in cents, not dollars. |
| `verified_query` | Getting a correct answer required combining several non-obvious fixes and re-deriving that combination is expensive. | The exact SQL for "monthly revenue," confirmed against a dashboard. |
| `join_path` | Two plausible join keys exist and one is broken, deprecated, or silently drops/duplicates rows. | Join on `customer_key`, not `customer_id` (47% NULL). |
| `caveat` | The data is correct as far as it goes but incomplete, stale, or scope-restricted in a way that matters. | Table only contains `us-east` orders; international orders live elsewhere. |
| `metric_definition` | A named business metric (revenue, active users, churn) has more than one plausible SQL definition and one has been confirmed correct. | "Revenue" excludes cancelled/refunded orders. |

## The learning record schema (SPEC.md §4)

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | UUID4, assigned once at creation, never changes. |
| `kind` | yes | One of the five above. |
| `subject_urn` | yes | The dataset entity urn. |
| `subject_field` | optional | Column name within `subject_urn`, if column-scoped. Omit for table-level. |
| `claim` | yes | 1–2 sentences, ≤280 chars. Longer usually means two learnings. |
| `evidence` | yes | Concrete and checkable: a query + result, a count, a named comparison. Never "seems right." ≤500 chars. |
| `confidence` | yes | `high` \| `medium` \| `low`; see below. |
| `learned_by` | yes | `<agent-name>/<session-id>`. |
| `learned_at` | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `status` | optional, default `active` | `active` \| `disputed` \| `conflict`. |
| `conflicts_with` | optional | Present only when `status: conflict`; the `id` of the disputed record. |

Serialization: one learning = one single-line JSON object (omit absent optional fields), one JSON string per value in the `io.datahub.agentMemory.learnings` structured property's value list.

## Confidence: honest definitions, applied as written (SPEC.md §4, §6)

| Level | Definition | Applied during recall as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `high` | Verified against an independent, trusted source and matched. | Apply directly, no re-derivation. |
| `medium` | Internally consistent and compelling, but not independently cross-checked. | Apply provisionally + one cheap targeted check before relying on it for a consequential answer. |
| `low` | A plausible explanation, not tested. Rare; a learning this weak is often not worth writing. | Hint only; independently verify before treating as true. |

## Structured property definition (SPEC.md §5.1)

```yaml
id: io.datahub.agentMemory.learnings
type: string
cardinality: MULTIPLE
entityTypes: [dataset, schemaField]
```

Registered once via `setup/register_properties.py`: no MCP tool defines property schemas, only assigns values to properties that already exist.
